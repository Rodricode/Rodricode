<h3> About me </h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is Rodrigo Flores, and with great power comes great responsibility, this is my gift, my curse, who am I? I'm spider-man! I'm just kidding
  i'm not really spider-man, but I am an apsiring web developer! Here is a little about myself, I am a very outgoing person, views from high hills overlooking the city are one of my
  favorite places to go.I am a big comic book fanatic, my favorite hero is Batman, and my favorite villian is the joker! I have aquired my knowledge for web development through a nice website
  called Skillcrush, it has taught me to be a clean and ellegant coder.
</p>
  <br>
<p>I can't wait to work with you!</p>
